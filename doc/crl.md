You can easily build a Flask service to serve a locally stored **CRL file** (`.crl`) to applications that call a specific URL (e.g., `/myca.crl`). Here's a step-by-step example:

## 🛠️ Step-by-step Flask CRL Server

### 🗂️ Directory structure:
```
your_project/
├── crl/
│   └── myca.crl
└── app.py
```

### 📄 `app.py` – minimal Flask server:
```python
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

# Serve CRL from this local folder
CRL_FOLDER = "crl"

@app.route("/myca.crl", methods=["GET"])
def download_crl():
    return send_from_directory(CRL_FOLDER, "myca.crl", mimetype="application/pkix-crl")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

---

## 🔍 Explanation:
- `send_from_directory` ensures Flask safely serves static files.
- `mimetype="application/pkix-crl"` is the correct MIME type for a DER-encoded CRL file (RFC 5280).
- The CRL will be available at: `http://<your-server>:8080/myca.crl`

---

## 🧪 To test:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/myca.crl --output myca.crl
```

You should receive the exact file stored in `crl/myca.crl`.

---

## 🚀 Optional Enhancements:
- Enable HTTPS with `Flask-TLS` or behind nginx.
- Add logging or access control if needed.
- Auto-update the CRL from your CA using a cron job or internal mechanism.

Would you like it to support both **PEM** and **DER** formats based on request headers or URL path (e.g., `/myca.der`, `/myca.pem`)? I can help set that up too.
